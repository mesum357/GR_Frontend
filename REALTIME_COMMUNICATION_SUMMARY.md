## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 1. WebSocket Service (`src/services/WebSocketService.ts`)
**Purpose**: Centralized real-time communication management

**Key Features**:
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Event listener management with proper cleanup
- Authentication for both riders and drivers
- Fare offer and response handling
- Connection status monitoring
- Error handling and recovery

**API Methods**:
- `authenticate(userId, userType)` - Authenticate user
- `sendFareOffer(rideRequestId, driverId, offerData)` - Send fare offer to rider
- `sendFareResponse(rideRequestId, riderId, action)` - Send response to driver
- `on(event, callback)` - Add event listener
- `off(event, callback)` - Remove event listener
- `disconnect()` - Disconnect from server
- `reconnect()` - Manually reconnect

### 2. FareOfferModal (`src/components/FareOfferModal.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Driver's "Wait for Reply" modal with countdown

**Key Features**:
- 30-second countdown timer with progress bar
- Fixed timer reset issues using `useRef`
- Proper cleanup of all timers and intervals
- Visual progress indication
- Automatic timeout handling

**Props**:
- `visible: boolean` - Modal visibility
- `onClose: () => void` - Close handler
- `onComplete: () => void` - Timeout handler
- `fareAmount: number` - Fare amount to display
- `arrivalTime: number` - Arrival time in minutes

### 3. RiderOfferModal (`src/components/RiderOfferModal.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Rider's offer acceptance modal

**Key Features**:
- 30-second countdown timer with progress bar
- Accept/Decline buttons with proper styling
- Driver information display (name, rating, vehicle)
- Fare amount and arrival time display
- Timeout handling

**Props**:
- `visible: boolean` - Modal visibility
- `onClose: () => void` - Close handler
- `onAccept: () => void` - Accept handler
- `onDecline: () => void` - Decline handler
- `onTimeout?: () => void` - Timeout handler
- `driverName: string` - Driver's name
- `driverRating: number` - Driver's rating
- `fareAmount: number` - Offered fare amount
- `arrivalTime: number` - Arrival time in minutes
- `vehicleInfo: string` - Vehicle information

### 4. Backend WebSocket Handlers (`backend/server.js`)
**Purpose**: Server-side real-time event handling

**New Event Handlers**:
- `fare_offer` - Handle driver fare offers
- `fare_response` - Handle rider responses
- `fare_response_confirmed` - Confirm response to rider

**Key Features**:
- Real-time message routing between riders and drivers
- Database updates for offer status
- Atomic operations for data consistency
- Error handling and validation
- Connection management

### 5. Updated Components

#### RideRouteModal (`src/components/RideRouteModal.tsx`)
- Integrated WebSocket service
- Real-time fare offer sending
- Response handling from riders
- Proper event listener management

#### RiderScreen (`src/screens/RiderScreen.tsx`)
- WebSocket authentication
- Real-time driver offer handling
- RiderOfferModal integration
- Response sending to drivers

## 🔄 Communication Flow

### Driver Flow:
1. Driver accepts ride request or offers fare
2. FareOfferModal appears with 30-second countdown
3. WebSocket sends offer to rider
4. Driver waits for rider response
5. On response: Modal closes and appropriate action taken
6. On timeout: Modal closes and returns to ride requests

### Rider Flow:
1. Rider is searching for drivers
2. Driver sends fare offer via WebSocket
3. RiderOfferModal appears with offer details
4. Rider can accept or decline within 30 seconds
5. Response sent to driver via WebSocket
6. Both modals close and appropriate action taken

## 🛡️ Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Network Issues:
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation when offline
- User notification of connection status

### Modal Edge Cases:
- App backgrounding: Timers continue running
- Multiple offers: Latest offer takes precedence
- Rapid open/close: Proper cleanup prevents conflicts

### Database Consistency:
- Atomic updates for offer status
- Proper rollback on errors
- Consistent state across all clients

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

### Memory Management:
- All timers and intervals properly cleaned up
- Event listeners removed on component unmount
- No memory leaks from WebSocket connections

### Real-time Performance:
- WebSocket messages delivered instantly
- UI updates smooth and responsive
- No blocking operations on main thread

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Files Created:
- `src/tests/RealtimeCommunicationTest.md` - Comprehensive test guide
- `src/tests/WebSocketTest.ts` - Integration test script

### Test Coverage:
- Connection and authentication
- Fare offer and response flows

- Timer accuracy and cleanup
- Modal state management
