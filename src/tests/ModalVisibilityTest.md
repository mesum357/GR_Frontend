# iOS Modal Visibility Test

## Test Plan for FindingDriversModal iOS Fix

### Prerequisites
- iOS Simulator (iPhone 11/12/14) or physical iOS device
- iOS versions: 14, 15, 16 (if available)
- Android device for comparison

### Test Cases

#### Test 1: Basic Modal Visibility
**Steps:**
1. Cold app start
2. Navigate to route screen
3. Set pickup and destination locations
4. Press "Find driver" button

**Expected Result:**
- Modal appears immediately on iOS (same as Android)
- Console shows: "ðŸ”§ FindingDriversModal: onShow fired - modal is now visible"
- Modal UI is interactive

**Pass Criteria:**
- âœ… Modal visible immediately
- âœ… onShow event fires
- âœ… No flicker or double-mount

#### Test 2: Heavy Map Initialization
**Steps:**
1. Set up route screen
2. Simulate heavy map work (add synchronous loop in map initialization)
3. Press "Find driver" button

**Expected Result:**
- Modal UI appears immediately (loader/fare controls visible)
- Map loads in background without blocking modal presentation

**Pass Criteria:**
- âœ… Modal UI visible while map loads
- âœ… No blocking of modal presentation

#### Test 3: Animation Type Variations
**Steps:**
1. Test with `animationType="slide"` (default)
2. Test with `animationType="none"`
3. Test with `presentationStyle="fullScreen"` (default)
4. Test with no `presentationStyle`

**Expected Result:**
- Modal appears with all animation types
- No difference in visibility timing

**Pass Criteria:**
- âœ… All animation types work
- âœ… No animation-related blocking

#### Test 4: Multiple Open/Close Cycles
**Steps:**
1. Open modal
2. Close modal
3. Repeat 5 times

**Expected Result:**
- Modal opens and closes consistently
- No memory leaks or mounting issues

**Pass Criteria:**
- âœ… Consistent behavior across cycles
- âœ… No mounting/unmounting errors

#### Test 5: Android Regression Test
**Steps:**
1. Test on Android device
2. Follow Test 1 steps

**Expected Result:**
- Modal appears immediately (no change from before)
- No performance degradation

**Pass Criteria:**
- âœ… Android behavior unchanged
- âœ… No regressions

### Debug Logs to Monitor

**Expected Console Output on iOS:**
```
ðŸš— handleFindDriver called with: { fare: 100, paymentMethod: 'Cash', autoAccept: false }
ðŸ”§ useShowModalWithIOSFix: Opening modal
ðŸ”§ iOS: Using InteractionManager + requestAnimationFrame + setTimeout
ðŸ”§ FindingDriversModal: Component mounted
ðŸ”§ FindingDriversModal: useEffect triggered, visible: true
ðŸ”§ FindingDriversModal: Modal is visible, loading route and starting search
ðŸ”§ iOS: Setting visible to true
ðŸ”§ FindingDriversModal: onShow fired - modal is now visible
```

**Expected Console Output on Android:**
```
ðŸš— handleFindDriver called with: { fare: 100, paymentMethod: 'Cash', autoAccept: false }
ðŸ”§ useShowModalWithIOSFix: Opening modal
ðŸ”§ Android: Setting visible immediately
ðŸ”§ FindingDriversModal: Component mounted
ðŸ”§ FindingDriversModal: useEffect triggered, visible: true
ðŸ”§ FindingDriversModal: Modal is visible, loading route and starting search
ðŸ”§ FindingDriversModal: onShow fired - modal is now visible
```

### Troubleshooting

**If modal still doesn't appear:**
1. Check if `onShow` event fires
2. Verify `visible` prop is true
3. Check for z-index conflicts
4. Try `animationType="none"`
5. Consider switching to `react-native-modal`

**If onShow doesn't fire:**
- Native presentation didn't occur
- Check for ancestor view blocking
- Verify modal is at top level of component tree

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Modal appears immediately on iOS when "Find driver" pressed
- [ ] Android behavior unchanged
- [ ] onShow event fires consistently
- [ ] No flicker or double-mount issues
- [ ] Modal UI interactive while map loads
- [ ] All animation types work
- [ ] Multiple open/close cycles work
